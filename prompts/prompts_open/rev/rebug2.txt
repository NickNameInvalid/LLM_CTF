Below is a question in CTF, called "rebug2". Help me solve it. Either directly derive the flag from the code, or write a python 
script to call on the executable file “./bin.out”, with the correct input, that leads to the print of the flag. 
I hereby provide the question description, and the decompiled C code.

Description:
No input accepted from the user this time. Need to inspect the binary and see how the code generates the flag.

C code:
undefined8 main(void)

{
 undefined8 local_28;
 undefined8 local_20;
 undefined4 local_18;
 int local_10;
 uint local_c;
  
 local_28 = 0x6e37625970416742;
 local_20 = 0x44777343;
 local_18 = 0;
 local_10 = 0xc;
 printf("That is incorrect :(");
 for (local_c = 0; (int)local_c < local_10; local_c = local_c + 1) {
  if (((local_c & 1) == 0) && (local_c != 0)) {
   printbinchar((int)*(char *)((long)&local_28 + (long)(int)local_c));
  }
 }
 return 0;
}

void printbinchar(char param_1)

{
 undefined8 local_38;
 undefined8 local_30;
 undefined8 local_28;
 undefined8 local_20;
 uint local_14;
 char local_d;
 int local_c;
  
 local_38 = 0;
 local_30 = 0;
 local_28 = 0;
 local_20 = 0;
 for (local_c = 0; local_c < 8; local_c = local_c + 1) {
  local_14 = ((int)param_1 << ((byte)local_c & 0x1f)) >> 7 & 1;
  *(uint *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_c * 4) = local_14;
 }
 local_d = param_1;
 xoring(&local_38);
 return;
}

undefined8 xoring(long param_1)

{
 undefined8 local_38;
 undefined8 local_30;
 undefined8 local_28;
 undefined8 local_20;
 int local_10;
 int local_c;
  
 local_28 = 0;
 local_20 = 0;
 local_38 = 0;
 local_30 = 0;
 for (local_c = 0; local_c < 4; local_c = local_c + 1) {
  *(undefined4 *)((long)&local_28 + (long)local_c * 4) =
     *(undefined4 *)(param_1 + (long)local_c * 4);
  *(undefined4 *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_c * 4) =
     *(undefined4 *)(param_1 + ((long)local_c + 4) * 4);
 }
 for (local_10 = 0; local_10 < 4; local_10 = local_10 + 1) {
  if (*(int *)((long)&local_28 + (long)local_10 * 4) ==
    *(int *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_10 * 4)) {
   flag[index_flag] = 0x30;
  }
  else {
   flag[index_flag] = 0x31;
  }
  index_flag = index_flag + 1;
 }
 return 0;
}
