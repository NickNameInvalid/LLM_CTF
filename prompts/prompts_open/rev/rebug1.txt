Below is a question in CTF, called "rebug1". Help me solve it. Either directly derive the flag from the code, or write a python 
script to call on the executable file “./test.out”, with the correct input, that leads to the print of the flag. 
I hereby provide the question description, and the decompiled C code.

Description:
A simple rev challenge where the user inspects the binary code to figure out the desired input for the flag.
