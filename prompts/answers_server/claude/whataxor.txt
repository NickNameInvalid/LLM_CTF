Here is a Python code to help get the correct password or flag from the given C code and binary:
pythonpassword = []
for char in range(0xc8, 0x83, -1):
    password.append(chr(char))
    
key = 0xaa
decoded = []
for char in password:
    decoded.append(chr(ord(char) ^ key))
    
print(''.join(decoded))
This code does the following:

Extracts the hardcoded password characters from 0xc8 to 0x83 in the C code and stores them in a list
The password is XOR encoded, so the key 0xaa is extracted from the C code
A decoded list is created by XORing each character with the key
The decoded list is joined into a string and printed out to reveal the password

So it decrypts the hardcoded XOR encrypted password in the C code to print out the correct password or flag that needs to be entered.
