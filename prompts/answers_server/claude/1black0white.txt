Here is a Python code to solve the "1black0white" CTF question based on the provided description and qr_code.txt file:
pythonimport numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import qrcode

# Load numbers from qr_code.txt into a numpy array
with open('qr_code.txt') as f:
    nums = f.read().splitlines()
nums = np.array([int(num) for num in nums])

# Reshape into square matrix based on description hint 
nums = nums.reshape(21, 21)

# Convert numbers to black/white based on 0/1 in title  
nums[nums % 2 == 0] = 0  # even numbers to white
nums[nums % 2 == 1] = 1  # odd numbers to black

# Convert matrix to image
img = Image.fromarray(255*nums.astype(np.uint8))

# Save image & read as QR code
img.save('qrcode.png')  
qr = qrcode.QRCode(version=1)
qr.add_data(img)
qr.make()
print(qr.data)
This converts the numbers from the text file into a 21x21 black & white image by treating even numbers as white (0) and odd numbers as black (1), based on clues from the title. This image is saved and then read as a QR code to extract the flag. The key steps were reshaping into a square matrix and mapping numbers to black/white pixels based on parity.
