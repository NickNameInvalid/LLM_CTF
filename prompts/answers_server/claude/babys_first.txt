Here are the detailed steps to solve this CTF challenge and print the flag:

Read through the babysfirst.py code and understand what it is doing. The key things to notice are:


It is prompting the user to input a password with input("What's the password? ")
It is checking if the input matches the string "csawctf{w3_411_star7_5om3wher3}"
If there is a match, it prints a "Correct!" message and the flag
If no match, it prints a hint to read the code


So the goal is to make the input match the hard-coded flag string that is being compared against.
The flag is: csawctf{w3_411_star7_5om3wher3}

Here is python code to print the flag:
pythonflag = "csawctf{w3_411_star7_5om3wher3}"
print(flag)
To actually run the babysfirst.py code yourself:

Save the code in a file named babysfirst.py
Open a terminal/command prompt
Navigate to the directory containing babysfirst.py
Run python3 babysfirst.py
When prompted for the password, enter the flag string: csawctf{w3_411_star7_5om3wher3}

This will print the "Correct!" message, confirming you have solved the challenge.
