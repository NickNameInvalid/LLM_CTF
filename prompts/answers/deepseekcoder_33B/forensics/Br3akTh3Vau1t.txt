To solve this CTF challenge, we need to understand how Ansible Vault works and how it encrypts and decrypts data. Ansible Vault uses a symmetric encryption algorithm (AES256) to encrypt and decrypt data. The encryption key is derived from a password provided by the user.

The given `runme.yml` Ansible playbook is designed to create a vault file, add a secret to it, and then encrypt it using Ansible Vault. The encrypted vault file is then configured in the `ansible.cfg` file.

The `vars/main.yml` file contains the secret that is added to the vault file. The secret is then passed through a Circular Bit Shifter, which is a custom encryption algorithm that shifts bits in a circular manner.

To solve this challenge, we need to:

1. Decrypt the vault file using the provided password.
2. Read the secret from the decrypted vault file.
3. Reverse the Circular Bit Shifter to get the original secret.
4. Decode the secret from Base64 to get the flag.

Let's write a Python script to automate these steps:

```python
import yaml
import base64
import ansible_vault
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad

# Circular Bit Shifter decryption function
def circular_bit_shifter_decrypt(data, shift):
    return bytes([(b >> shift | b << (8 - shift)) & 0xFF for b in data])

# Ansible Vault password
vault_password = 'your_vault_password'

# Path to the encrypted vault file
vault_file_path = 'path_to_encrypted_vault_file'

# Decrypt the vault file
decrypted_data = ansible_vault.Vault(vault_password).load(open(vault_file_path).read())

# Extract the secret from the decrypted data
secret = yaml.safe_load(decrypted_data)['sus1337']

# Reverse the Circular Bit Shifter for all 3 variables
for shift in range(8):
    decrypted_secret = circular_bit_shifter_decrypt(base64.b64decode(secret), shift)
    try:
        flag = base64.b64decode(decrypted_secret).decode('utf-8')
        print(f"Flag: {flag}")
        break
    except:
        continue
```

Please replace `'your_vault_password'` with the actual vault password and `'path_to_encrypted_vault_file'` with the path to the encrypted vault file.

This script assumes that the Circular Bit Shifter is a simple bitwise shift operation. If the actual implementation is different, the `circular_bit_shifter_decrypt` function will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Please note that this script assumes that the secret is encoded in Base64 twice, once before the Circular Bit Shifter and once after. If the secret is encoded only once, the script will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Also, this script uses the `ansible_vault` package, which is not a standard Python package. You can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install ansible-vault
```

Remember that this script is a starting point and may need to be adjusted based on the actual implementation of the Circular Bit Shifter and the encryption process.
