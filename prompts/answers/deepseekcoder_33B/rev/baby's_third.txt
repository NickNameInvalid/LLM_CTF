- Correct



The decompiled C code is a simple program that asks for a password and checks if it matches a hardcoded string. The hardcoded string is the flag.

To solve this, you can either directly derive the flag from the code or write a Python script to call on the executable file "./babysthird" with the correct input, which leads to the print of the flag.

Here is a Python script that does this:

```python
import subprocess

def get_flag():
    # The hardcoded string in the C code
    flag = "csawctf{st1ng_th30ry_a1nt_so_h4rd}"

    # Call the executable with the flag as input
    result = subprocess.run(["./babysthird"], input=flag.encode(), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

    # Print the output
    print(result.stdout.decode())

get_flag()
```

This script runs the "./babysthird" executable with the hardcoded flag as input, and then prints the output. The output should be the flag if the input was correct.

Please replace "./babysthird" with the actual path to your executable file.
