# Blocky Noncense

Category: crypto
Suggested Points: 400

# Description

The goal of this challenge was to create a simple "blockchain" that uses the previous block to generate new ecdsa signatures. The first block contains the signed signature of the flag and the server allows users to sign as many messages as they want. However, the twist to this challenge is that the nonce is generated by a cubic congruential generator, meaning that all nonces are related to each other. This allows users to perform a related nonce attack.

# Deployment

The `src` folder has all the files necessary to run on the server. The file that should be run on the server is `chall.sage` as it imports all the other files.
`dist.zip` is the main files to be distributed to players with the redacted flag.
The `solve` folder just contains the solve script.
