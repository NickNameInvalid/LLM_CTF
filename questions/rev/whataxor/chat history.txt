The first time the python code had bug; the second time the code's output was like this:
Invalid character encountered: -157
Original password: sawctf{0ne_sheeP_1wo_sheWp_2hree_5heeks____z___zzz_____zzzzzz____xor}
The output missed the first "c", but in general it was correct.
The third time it became correct.
