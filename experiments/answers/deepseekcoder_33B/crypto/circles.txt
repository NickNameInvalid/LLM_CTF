Below is a question in CTF, called "circles". Help me solve it. Give detailed steps and write a python code that solves the problem, that leads to the print of the flag. 
I hereby provide the question description, and the related file "server.py".

Description:
The goal of this challenge is to figure out that the given pattern of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... coupled with the challenge description indicates that the pattern is associated with Moser's Circles.

Code:
server.py:

from secret import special_function
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad

with open('flag.png','rb') as f:
	data = f.read()

key = special_function(0xcafed3adb3ef1e37).to_bytes(32,"big")
iv = b"r4nd0m_1v_ch053n"
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
enc = cipher.encrypt(pad(data,AES.block_size))

with open('flag.enc','wb') as f:
	f.write(enc)

def special_function(n):
	if n < 1:
		return 1
	else:
		return 1 + (n*(n**3 - 6*(n**2) + 23*n - 18)//24)
