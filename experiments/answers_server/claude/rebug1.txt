Based on the C code, it looks like we need to enter a string that is 12 characters long (checked by the for loop with local_c) in order for the "that's correct!" message to print and the flag to be generated.
To solve this, we can write a simple Python script that calls the executable with the correct input:
pythonimport subprocess

input_str = "A" * 12
p = subprocess.Popen("./test.out", stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
out, err = p.communicate(input=input_str.encode())
print(out.decode())
This script creates a 12 character input string of all 'A's, runs the executable, and prints the output.
The key things it's doing:

Creates a 12 char input string
Opens the executable for input/output
Sends the input string
Decodes and prints the output

So this should call the program with the right input to print the flag.
Let me know if you need any other help analyzing the binary or coming up with the solution script!
