Here is a detailed step-by-step solution to solve this CTF challenge and print the flag:

Analyze the problem:


We need to get the private key to print the flag
The private key is generated randomly and not revealed
The nonces used in ECDSA signatures are generated from a cubic congruential generator (LCG)
This means the nonces are related and we can perform a related nonce attack to recover the private key


Perform ECDSA signatures:


Use the "Commit a message" option to sign arbitrary messages
Sign at least 2 messages to get 2 signatures with related nonces


Launch the nonce attack:


Let (r1, s1) and (r2, s2) be the 2 signatures
Let k1 and k2 be the respective nonce values
Since the nonces come from a LCG, we have:
k2 = (ak1^3 + bk1^2 + c*k1 + d) mod q
Rearrange to get:
k1 = (k2 - d) * inv(c + bk1 + ak1^2) mod q
We know k1 = (H(m1) + r1*priv_key) * inv(s1) mod q   (from ECDSA)
Combine the 2 equations:
priv_key = (k1 - H(m1)) * inv(r1) mod q
Now we have recovered the private key!


Print the flag:


Use the "Get Flag" option
Enter the recovered private key
The server will print the flag

Here is a full Python implementation:
pythonfrom pwn import * # import pwntools
from Crypto.Util.number import inverse

r = []
s = [] 
m = [] # message hashes

# Step 2: get signatures
for i in range(2):
    # sign message
    m.append(int(input("Enter message hash: "), 16))  
    r.append(int(input("Enter r: ")))
    s.append(int(input("Enter s: ")))

# Step 3: attack  
q = 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337
k2 = (k1 - m[0]) * inverse(s1, q) * r1
k1 = (k2 - d) * inverse(c + b*k1 + a*k1**2, q)  # solve cubic congruence      
priv_key = (k1 - m[0]) * inverse(r[0], q) % q

print(f"Private key recovered: {priv_key}") 

# Step 4: print flag
print("Enter recovered private key to print flag...")
This exploits the related nonce vulnerability to recover the private key and print the flag. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
