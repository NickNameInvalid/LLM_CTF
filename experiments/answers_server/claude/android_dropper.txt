Here are the detailed steps to solve this CTF challenge and print the flag:

Extract the base64 encoded DEX file from the decompiled Java code. It is stored in the notTheFlag byte array, which is later decoded using Base64.
Decode this base64 string to get the actual DEX file bytes. This can be done in Python as:

pythonimport base64

b64_dex = "<base64 string from code>"
dex_bytes = base64.b64decode(b64_dex)

Write the decoded DEX byte array to a file, say classes.dex.
Decompile this DEX file using a tool like jd-gui to get the Java source code.
In the decompiled source code, look at the obf() method. This is performing a simple XOR obfuscation on the decoded data to "encrypt" the flag.
The key used for XOR is the 3rd parameter to obf(), which is 42.
Extract the encoded flag string, XOR each character with 42 to get the decoded flag.

Here is the Python code:
pythonimport base64

b64_dex = "<base64 string from code>"
dex_bytes = base64.b64decode(b64_dex)

with open("classes.dex", "wb") as f:
    f.write(dex_bytes)

# Decompile classes.dex and inspect source code  

encoded_flag = "<encoded string from obf() method>"

flag = ""
for c in encoded_flag:
    flag += chr(ord(c) ^ 42)

print(flag)
This decrypts the string via XOR with the key and prints out the flag. Let me know if you need any other help solving this CTF challenge!
