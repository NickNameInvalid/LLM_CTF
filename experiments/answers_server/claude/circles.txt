Here are the detailed steps to solve this CTF challenge called "circles":

The description mentions Moser's circles, which is a pattern of circles with radii 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. This corresponds to the special_function in the code, which generates 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc based on the input number.
This means the key used to encrypt the flag is derived from some number passed through the special_function. We need to reverse this function to find the original number.
Analyzing the special_function:

It outputs 1 if n < 1
Otherwise, it outputs 1 plus some polynomial expression involving n
By factoring, this polynomial can be written as (n^4 - 6n^3 + 23n^2 - 18*n) / 24


To reverse it:

If output is 1, input is < 1
Otherwise:
output - 1 = (n^4 - 6n^3 + 23n^2 - 18n) / 24
24(output-1) = n^4 - 6n^3 + 23n^2 - 18*n
Use this quartic equation to find n


Implementing this in Python:

pythonfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES

def find_n(output):
    if output == 1: 
        return 0  
    eq = 24*(output-1)   
    # Use sympy to solve quartic equation
    import sympy as sp
    n = sp.solve(sp.Eq(sp.symbols('n')**4 - 6*sp.symbols('n')**3 + 23*sp.symbols('n')**2 - 18*sp.symbols('n') - eq,0))[3] 
    return n

key_n = find_n(0xcafed3adb3ef1e37)
key = special_function(key_n).to_bytes(32,"big")

# Decrypt flag  
iv = b"r4nd0m_1v_ch053n"
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
flag = cipher.decrypt(open('flag.enc','rb').read())
print(flag)
This finds the original n that was passed to special_function, recreates the key, decrypts the flag data and prints out the flag.
