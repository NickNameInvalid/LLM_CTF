Here is one way to solve this CTF challenge and print the flag:
First, the key things we know from the description and code:

The program takes a hexadecimal input and jumps to that address as code
We need to input the address of the "cat flag" program to print the flag

Since we don't have access to the actual binary, we can make some assumptions:

The "cat flag" program is likely at a fixed address, e.g. 0x00400900
The flag is likely stored in a file called "flag.txt"

We can write a Python script that does the following:

Launch the "target_practice" binary using subprocess
Pass the assumed "cat flag" address 0x00400900 as a hexadecimal string input
Capture and print the output, which should contain the flag

Here is the Python code:
pythonimport subprocess

cat_flag_addr = "0x00400900"

p = subprocess.run(["./target_practice"], input=cat_flag_addr, capture_output=True)

print(p.stdout.decode())
When run, this should call the "cat flag" program within the target binary, print the flag contents to stdout, which we then capture and print.
Let me know if you would like me to explain or refine this solution further! I'm happy to provide more details or sample code.
