Here are the steps to solve this CTF challenge:

Examine the decompiled C code. We can see it is prompting for a password input, and checking if the input matches "csawctf{st1ng_th30ry_a1nt_so_h4rd}". So the flag is likely this string.
However, the binary is compiled and not human-readable. The challenge description tells us to use the strings command from binutils to extract readable strings from the binary.
Run strings babysthird | grep csawctf to search the strings output for the flag.
We find the flag: csawctf{st1ng_th30ry_a1nt_so_h4rd}

Here is the Python code to print out the flag:
pythonflag = "csawctf{st1ng_th30ry_a1nt_so_h4rd}"
print(flag)
To summarize:

Examine decompiled code to find expected flag format
Use strings command on binary to extract strings
Search strings output to find flag
Print flag in Python
