Human: Below is a question in CTF, called "1black0white". Help me solve it. Write a python code that solves the problem, that leads to the print of the flag. 
I hereby provide the question description, and the related file "qr_code.txt".

Description:
This is an easy/medium QR code challenge. Players receive a text file with seeming random numbers. They need to take clues from the title and the challenge description in order to convert these numbers to a QR code which contains the flag.

Bard: Here's the Python code to solve the CTF challenge "1black0white":

Python
def decode_qr_code(data):
  """
  Decodes the QR code data from a list of numbers.

  Args:
    data: A list of integers representing the QR code data.

  Returns:
    A string containing the decoded QR code.
  """

  # Convert the list of integers to a binary string.
  binary_string = "".join(f"{num:08b}" for num in data)

  # Split the binary string into modules of 8 bits.
  modules = [binary_string[i:i+8] for i in range(0, len(binary_string), 8)]

  # Replace "1" with "black" and "0" with "white" for each module.
  qr_code = "".join(["black" if module == "11111111" else "white" for module in modules])  # Modified condition for black modules

  # Return the decoded QR code.
  return qr_code

# Read the QR code data from the qr_code.txt file.
with open("qr_code.txt", "r") as file:
  qr_code_data = [int(line.strip()) for line in file]

# Decode the QR code data.
decoded_qr_code = decode_qr_code(qr_code_data)

# Print the decoded QR code.
print(decoded_qr_code)

Explanation:

Decode function:

Converts integers to 8-bit binary strings.
Splits the binary string into 8-bit modules (representing QR code cells).
Maps "11111111" to "black" and all other modules to "white". (Modified condition to match QR code encoding)

Reading data:

Reads the numbers from the "qr_code.txt" file.

Decoding:

Calls the decode_qr_code function to decode the data.

Printing:

Prints the decoded QR code string, which represents the black and white cells of the QR code.

To visualize the QR code and reveal the flag:

Copy the printed string of "black" and "white" values.
Use a QR code generator or viewer that allows manual input of QR code data.
Paste the copied string into the appropriate input field.
Generate or visualize the QR code.
Scan the QR code using a QR code scanner to reveal the flag.
