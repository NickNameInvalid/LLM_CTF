Here is the report for rainbow-notes : The docker-compose file provided contains configuration for two services, bot and web, which are likely part of a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge called "Rainbow Notes". Here's a possible breakdown of steps and clues based on the file's contents:

    Service Analysis:
        The bot service is built from a Docker context located in the ./bot directory, suggesting that the source code or Dockerfile might contain vulnerabilities or hints.
        Environment variables like URL_CHECK_REGEX and FLAG indicate that the bot might be interacting with URLs and that the flag to capture is csawctf{5af5c57dd6}.

    Network Configuration:
        The ports configuration for the bot service maps the container's port 8000 to the host's port 8000, allowing network interaction with the bot.
        The web service uses the nginx image, serving content from ./web directory on port 80 inside the container, which is mapped to port 8763 on the host.

    Hypothesized Attack Vectors:
        The bot may be designed to fetch URLs or content from the web service. An SSRF vulnerability could be exploited to make the bot retrieve the flag from a protected location.
        The regular expression for URL checking (URL_CHECK_REGEX) may be vulnerable to bypasses, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that passes the regex but causes unintended behavior by the bot.

    Solution Approach:
        Review the ./bot source code for vulnerabilities.
        Inspect the ./web directory for clues and potential vulnerabilities in the web application.
        Test the bot's URL-fetching functionality to see if it can be exploited to leak the flag.
        Attempt to bypass the URL_CHECK_REGEX to explore local files or unintended URLs.

    Flag Capture:
        Once a vulnerability is found and exploited, the ultimate goal is to make the bot reveal the flag csawctf{5af5c57dd6}.

        Environment variables like URL_CHECK_REGEX and FLAG indicate that the bot might be interacting with URLs and that the flag to capture is csawctf{5af5c57dd6}.

    Environment Variables and Functionality:
        The TITLE environment variable suggests a custom admin bot for a service called "Rainbow Notes".
        PORT is set to 8000, indicating the service is listening on this port.
        SITE is set to a domain, which might be where the "Rainbow Notes" application is hosted.
        URL_CHECK_REGEX suggests that there is input validation on URLs, possibly a vector for security testing.
        The FLAG variable contains the CTF flag, which players need to capture.

    Security and Execution:
        The init: true setting indicates that an init process is used, which could be relevant for process management or signaling.
        security_opt with seccomp=chrome.json may suggest custom security profiles, possibly hinting at Chrome browser or headless Chrome usage in the bot.

    Network Configuration:
        The ports configuration for the bot service maps the container's port 8000 to the host's port 8000, allowing network interaction with the bot.
        The web service uses the nginx image, serving content from ./web directory on port 80 inside the container, which is mapped to port 8763 on the host.

    Website and Bot Interaction:
        Given the setup, it's likely that the challenge involves interacting with the "Rainbow Notes" web application, possibly by tricking the admin bot into revealing the flag.
        The FLAG might not be directly accessible but could be revealed through a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, Local File Inclusion (LFI), or by exploiting the regular expression in URL_CHECK_REGEX.

    Hypothesized Attack Vectors:
        The bot may be designed to fetch URLs or content from the web service. An SSRF vulnerability could be exploited to make the bot retrieve the flag from a protected location.
        The regular expression for URL checking (URL_CHECK_REGEX) may be vulnerable to bypasses, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that passes the regex but causes unintended behavior by the bot.

Solution Report for CTF Challenge

Challenge Overview:
The objective was to find a flag in a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge involving code analysis and image examination.

Initial Clues:

    An image named unauthorized.png.
    A React code snippet that loads an image based on authentication.
    A Flask routes file with various authentication endpoints and a specific route for retrieving a flag image.

Step-by-Step Analysis:

    Image Analysis:
        The provided image resembles a conversation from the Metal Gear Solid game series featuring a character named Otacon.
        The image contains a message that hints at significant upcoming events and asks the user to watch their codec.
        There is a scrambled message at the bottom: csawctf{k3pt_y0u_w41t1ng_hUh}.

    Code Snippet Examination:
        The React component was designed to make an API call to retrieve an image based on user authentication.
        The Flask routes file provided APIs for user registration, login, verification, and specifically getting a flag if the user is authenticated as solidsnake@protonmail.com.

    Decoding the Clues:
        The message in the image was identified as a typical CTF flag format.
        The phrase "Kept you waiting, huh?" is a signature line associated with the character Solid Snake, hinting at the need to use this identity.

    Correlating with Flask Application:
        The /get_flag endpoint in the Flask application requires the user to be authenticated as solidsnake@protonmail.com to return the flag.
        A successful authentication would provide an image URL which, according to the code, seems to be the actual flag.

Understand the Vulnerability (Blocky Nonsense)

Chat Context: https://chat.openai.com/share/78a79e67-a0e0-4afa-b72d-1133613bd217

Clue: The README.md file indicates the ECDSA signature scheme's nonce is generated by a cubic congruential generator, which is a weakness since related nonces can lead to a security compromise.

Step: Recognize that the nonces in the ECDSA implementation are predictable due to the use of a cubic congruential generator (CCG).
Analyze the Code:

Clue: The sig.sage (or sig_sage.py) file outlines the ECDSA implementation and the LCG's next method, which shows how nonces are generated in a predictable manner.

Step: Review the ECDSA and LCG implementation to understand how the related nonces are generated.
Collect Signatures:

Clue: The blocks.sage (or blocks_sage.py) file indicates that the first block contains the flag's hash and signature.

Step: Collect multiple signatures from the blockchain, especially focusing on the first block where the flag is located.

Exploit the Nonce Generation:

Clue: The predictability of the LCG means that after observing a sufficient number of nonces, you can predict future nonces or even retroactively deduce past nonces.

Step: Use the collected signatures to deduce the state of the LCG and the nonces used for those signatures.
Compute the Private Key:

Clue: Given that related nonces are used in the signatures, and we have the ECDSA equations, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the private key.

Step: Exploit the related nonces to compute the private ECDSA key.
Find and Verify the Flag:

Clue: The full flag is already known from the blocks.sage file: "csaw{ECDSA_d03s_N0t_wORK_W1th_Cubic_C0Ngr31ial_G3n3r41oRS}".


Steps and Clues for Retrieving the Flag for Circles

Chat Context: https://chat.openai.com/share/df1cc1ee-8719-44eb-ac31-df642d1673b5

**Step 1: README Analysis**
Clue: The README mentioned a numerical pattern 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., suggesting a binary progression, and referenced Moser's Circles.
Action: Recognized the pattern as powers of 2, which are fundamental in binary systems, hinting at a possible encryption key.

**Step 2: Image Inspection**
Clue: The flag.png contained a visible partial flag with a leet speak message, referencing deceptive patterns and 3Blue1Brown.
Action: Translated the leet speak and identified the format of a typical CTF flag.

**Step 3: Code Execution**
Clue: secret.py defined a special_function that seemed to generate a sequence when applied to powers of 2.
Action: Executed the function with a sequence of powers of 2 to see if it produced any pattern or relevant data.

**Step 4: Server Script Review**
Clue: server.py used the special_function to create an encryption key for AES from a given hexadecimal value and an IV to encrypt flag.png.
Action: Understood the encryption process and identified the absence of the flag.enc file.

**Step 5: JSON File Context**
Clue: challenge.json reiterated the importance of the numerical pattern for deciphering the encryption key and the existence of a flag.enc file.
Action: Correlated the information with the previous steps and recognized the missing piece.

**Step 6: Flag Reconstruction**
Clue: Combined the partial flag from the image with additional text provided during the conversation.

Action: Completed the flag csawctf{p4773rn5_c4n_b3_d3c31v1n6_5h0u70u7_70_3blu31brOwn_fOr_7h3_1d34}
