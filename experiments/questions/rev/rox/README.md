# rox 

This challenge primarily involves significant xoring of some data with the goal of getting a password which can open a file. None of the flags can open the file but the final one needs to be password matched to be continued.

Also this was compiled on GCC in FreeBSD so dynamic analysis would probably need a VM or some compatibility layer. You can open this up statically though.
