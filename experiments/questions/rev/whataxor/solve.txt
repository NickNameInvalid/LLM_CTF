This is the first "real" reversing task. You need to use a disassembler or decompiler to view the code. See readme.txt for some suggestions.

When you open the file, you should be able to tell that your input is getting mutated and then compared to a nonsense array.

The mutation happening to your input is a single-byte repeating XOR with a key of `0xAA`. If you apply that same transformation on the array, you get the flag (because XOR is symetric).
