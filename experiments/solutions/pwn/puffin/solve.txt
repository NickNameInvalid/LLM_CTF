AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! I'm freakin' out!

Jk, that's a valid answer though.

If you look at the stack in the function, there's 0x2c bytes reserved for the parameter that gets passed to fgets, but it gets 100 bytes of input.

Because of this, if you provide more than 2c bytes of input, you overwrite the next variable on the stack - the one that determines if the flag prints or not.

So just send a bunch of 'A's!
