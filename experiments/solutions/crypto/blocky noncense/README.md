# Blocky Noncense

Category: crypto
Suggested Points: 400

# Description

The goal of this challenge was to create a simple "blockchain" that uses the previous block to generate new ecdsa signatures. The first block contains the signed signature of the flag and the server allows users to sign as many messages as they want. However, the twist to this challenge is that the nonce is generated by a cubic congruential generator, meaning that all nonces are related to each other. This allows users to perform a related nonce attack.

# Deployment

The `src` folder has all the files necessary to run on the server. The file that should be run on the server is `chall.sage` as it imports all the other files.
`dist.zip` is the main files to be distributed to players with the redacted flag.
The `solve` folder just contains the solve script.

# Flag
`csaw{ECDSA_d03s_N0t_wORK_W1th_Cubic_C0Ngr31ial_G3n3r41oRS}`

# Solution

As mentioned above, this challenge uses a weak prng to generate its nonces, meaning that players can perform a related nonce attack. While making this challenge, I didn't know there was a [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/305.pdf) already explaining how to solve this problem but its alright. With a cubic congruential generator, it takes 6 signatures to get a polynomial over the elliptics order where one of its roots is the private key. Submitting the private key back to the server will get the flag.

The script to solve this is in `solve.sage`.
